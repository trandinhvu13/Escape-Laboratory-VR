# Escape Laboratory VR

## Introduction
This game was made for a college assignment.<br/> 
It was also the first time I was exposed to Unity Engine and C# and start learning them from the ground up.<br/>  
The game was gone through many versions and designs but in the end it was never finished and only usable for demonstation in class.<br/>

## About the game
You are stuck in a Pac-man-like maze lab and your mission is to find all the keys to get out of there.<br/>
You will have a gun and a radar tablet indicating the position of the keys.<br/>
There will be enemies wandering around the maze, use your gun to shoot them.<br/>
