# Escape Laboratory VR

## Introduction:
This game was made for a college assignment.
It was also the first time I was exposed to Unity Engine and C# and start learning them from the ground up.
The game was gone through many versions and designs but in the end it was never finished and only usable for demonstation in class.

## About the game:
You are stuck in a Pac-man-like maze lab and your mission is to find all the keys to get out of there. 
You will have a gun and a radar tablet indicating the position of the keys.
There will be enemies wandering around the maze, use your gun to shoot them.
